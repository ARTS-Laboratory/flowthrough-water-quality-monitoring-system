# Flow Through Water Quality Monitoring System

This system monitors water quality by measuring conductivity, pH, and temperature, ensuring continuous operation with minimal maintenance. Moreover, versions of this system enable the use of time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance to be performed in situ. It features a robust construction that protects electrical components from environmental damage, supports an adequate flow rate for in situ water sampling, and enables data transmission to a server for analysis.
